                <p>Electronic duo NEFFEX have dropped a fun new track for those lonely, Sunday
                    nights— “Sunday”. True, the lyrics are anything but sulky, but inspired by the “champagne
                    Sundays” that the two hosted at their Hollywood Hills house, there’s nothing that works better
                    than this to pump up your spirits as you wind down (or, start living your best life) at the
                    end of the week. Listen to “Sunday” below.
                    “We wrote “Sunday” after throwing these Champagne Sunday events at our house,” said the two.
                    “We would buy a ton of champagne and food and invite a bunch of different friends, influencers and
                    creatives to come by and party with us. Each one was an amazing time, so we tried to capture the
                    overall
                    vibe of those Sundays with this song.”</p>
