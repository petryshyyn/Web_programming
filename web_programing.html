<p><img src="R.PNG" width="110" , height="110" , class="photo">ecently, I stumbled across a quote from a Mozilla
    developer
    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/0107.html">about the tension inherent in
        creating standards</a>:</p>
<br>
<p>Implementations and specifications have to do a delicate dance together. You don’t want implementations</p>
<p align="left">to happen before the specification is finished, because people start depending on the details of</p>
<div class="text">
    <p>implementations and that constrains the specification. However, you also don’t want the specification to
        be</p>
    <p>finished before there are implementations and author experience with those implementations, because you need
        the</p>
    <p>feedback. There is unavoidable tension here, but we just have to muddle on through.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Keep this quote in the back of your mind, and let me explain how HTML5 came to be.</p>

<h1 align="center">MIME TYPES</h1>
<br>
<p>This book is about HTML5, not previous versions of HTML, and not any version of XHTML. But to understand the history
    of</p>
<p>HTML5 and the motivations behind it, you need to understand a few technical details first. Specifically, MIME
    types.</p>
<br>
<p>Every time your web browser requests a page, the web server sends “headers” before it sends the actual page markup.
    These</p>
<p>headers are normally invisible, although there are web development tools that will make them visible if you’re
    interested. But</p>
<p>the headers are important, because they tell your browser how to interpret the page markup that follows. The most
    important</p>
<p>header is called Content-Type, and it looks like this:</p>
<br>
<div class="text">
    <p>Content-Type: text/html</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>“text/html” is called the “content type” or “MIME type” of the page. This header is the only thing that determines
    what a</p>
<p>particular resource truly is, and therefore how it should be rendered. Images have their own MIME types (image/jpeg
    for</p>
<p>JPEG images, image/png for PNG images, and so on). JavaScript files have their own MIME type. CSS stylesheets have
    their</p>
<p>own MIME type. Everything has its own MIME type. The web runs on MIME types.</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, reality is more complicated than that. The first generation of web servers (and I’m talking web servers
    from 1993)</p>
<p>didn’t send the Content-Type header because it didn’t exist yet. (It wasn’t invented until 1994.) For compatibility
    reasons that</p>
<p>date all the way back to 1993, some popular web browsers will ignore the Content-Type header under certain
    circumstances</p>
<p>(This is called “content sniffing.”) But as a general rule of thumb, everything you’ve ever looked at on the web —
    HTML</p>
<p>pages, images, scripts, videos, PDFs, anything with a URL — has been served to you with a specific MIME type in
    the</p>
<p>Content-Type header.</p>
<br>
<p>Tuck that under your hat. We’ll come back to it.</p>

    <h1 align="center">A LONG DIGRESSION INTO HOW STANDARDS</h1>
    <h1 align="center">ARE MADE</h1>
</div>
<br>
<p>Why do we have an <.img> element? That’s not a question you hear every
    <img src="openclipart.org_johnny_automatic_monkey_reading.png" align="right"></p>
<p>day. Obviously someone must have created it. These things don’t just</p>
<p>appear out of nowhere. Every element, every attribute, every feature of</p>
<p>HTML that you’ve ever used — someone created them, decided how they</p>
<p>should work, and wrote it all down. These people are not gods, nor are</p>
<p>they flawless. They’re just people. Smart people, to be sure. But just</p>
<p>people.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the great things about standards that are developed “out in the</p>
<p>open” is that you can go back in time and answer these kinds of</p>
<p>questions. Discussions occur on mailing lists, which are usually archived</p>
<p>and publicly searchable. So I decided to do a bit of “email archaeology” to</p>
<p>try to answer the question, “Why do we have an <.img> element?” I had</p>
<p>to go back to before there was an organization called the World Wide</p>
<p>Web Consortium (W3C). I went back to the earliest days of the web,</p>
<p>when you could count the number of web servers with both hands and</p>
<p>maybe a couple of toes.</p>
