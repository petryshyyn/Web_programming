                catchy, danceable new single with an enjoyable, guitar-driven drop. Perfect for those summer nights,
                they say! Listen below.

            <td class="text">Electronic duo NEFFEX have dropped a fun new track for those lonely, Sunday
                nights— “Sunday”. True, the lyrics are anything but sulky, but inspired by the “champagne
                Sundays” that the two hosted at their Hollywood Hills house, there’s nothing that works better
                than this to pump up your spirits as you wind down (or, start living your best life) at the
                end of the week. Listen to “Sunday” below.
                “We wrote “Sunday” after throwing these Champagne Sunday events at our house,” said the two.
                “We would buy a ton of champagne and food and invite a bunch of different friends, influencers and
                creatives to come by and party with us. Each one was an amazing time, so we tried to capture the overall
                vibe of those Sundays with this song.”
                “Sunday” is Neffex’s second release this summer, having previously debuted their pop anthem “It’s My
                Life” earlier this month. A debut EP is currently in the works for the two, but most of the details are
                under wraps. The band is also gearing up for a short but exciting tour, kicking off Sept. 12 with a
                headlining date at LA’s The Troubadour. NEFFEX will then head to the Europe for their fall European
                tour, kicking off Oct. 15th in Zurich.

            <td class="text">Ask a YouTuber about finding background for their videos, and you’ll likely
                get a sigh and a long-suffering look. That’s because in many cases, YouTubers can’t find
                copyright-free or inexpensive-to-license music to use in their videos. And if they use even
                a few seconds of music that is copyrighted, they run the risk of their entire video getting
                demonetized. It’s a constant struggle — one NEFFEX wants to help ease.
                The duo, comprised of Cameron Wales and Brandon Horth, has dedicated all its creative
                efforts to making a library of professional, copyright-free songs for fellow creators
                (and anyone else) to use in their videos and other content. NEFFEX puts out a new song
                each Wednesday, an intensive endeavor that requires Wales and Horth to spend dozens of
                hours in the studio every week. NEFFEX’s offerings run the gamut from raw, electronic-heavy
                songs like most recent release “Rumors” to pounding rock anthem “Careless” to softer,
                Linkin Park-reminiscent “Broken Dreams.” Along with constantly producing music in varying genres,
                Wales and Horth manage NEFFEX’s sizeable merch shop and other arms of the behind-the-scenes business,
                including forays into new types of content.

                don’t fit that stereotype. In 2017 the pair, who dubbed their musical project Neffex, decided to
                challenge themselves and hone their skills by releasing a complete song a week for 100 weeks straight.
                Inspired by artists such as Lil Wayne and Russ, who were sporadically dropping full albums and
                releasing singles regularly online, Neffex uploaded a song at 9 a.m. every Wednesday to its social
                media pages including YouTube, as well as streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and Soundcloud.
                Savage and Wales also made the music available royalty-free for anyone to use for any project.
                All they asked in return was to be tagged or shared in whatever the material was used for. The
                self-released, mixed and produced songs, including “Fight Back,” “Rumors,” “Careless,” “Life,” “Soldier”
                and “Best of Me,” led to nearly 2 million YouTube subscribers and more than a billion total streams in
                two years.

                “Sunday” today.
                Inspired by the “Champagne Sundays” that the duo hosted at their Hollywood Hills house, the piece
                features the group’s
                own Bryce Savage (vocals) and Cameron Wales (guitar, decks) as they throw an unforgettable party with
                friends and
                endless bottles of champagne. Earlier today, Billboard exclusively premiered the video HERE and praised
                the song’s “vivid
                hook led by glassy synths”. Watch the video now HERE. “Sunday” was officially released last Friday,
                August 23rd via
                12Tone Music Group and was written, produced and mixed by the duo themselves. The track was preceded by
                NEFFEX’s pop
                anthem “It’s My Life”, which debuted earlier this month. “Working on Sunday was a blast,” said NEFFEX.
                “We wrote it based
                around the vibe of these Champagne Sunday events we used to throw at our place where we’d buy a ton of
                champagne and alcohol
                and invite all of our friends around LA to come over and just enjoy themselves. The music video captures
                the fun we had
                throwing those, and the different ways our friends all got to meet, interact with one another and party
                with us.”
